/* This rule is important, but only applicable to touch devices.  You want to 
disable the dialog box that appears on touch devices when you press and hold
the navigation arrows.   You have  to apply it to all the elements that the 
user might accidentally press with their finger while holding down a navigation
arrow.  For example, if they press half-on the arrow and half-off the arrow, they might get a popup
if the whole carousel and it's immediate surroundings do not have this
class applied.  Unfortunately, users can not select and highlight text or
images, but they can still interact with anchor elements. */

if you want a dynamic method of keeping the carousel items at a uniform height as 
the page expands and retracts.  Stick it into the redraw callback.  More on that 
in the documentation.

NOTE: Do not apply margin or border to the slider elements (li).  Make an inner 
container and apply it there if needed.
